# Simplified banking reporting system (test)

 One customer may have multiple credit card accounts. Your task will consist of two required steps: 
 
1. Design and implement a back-end system for managing credit card transactions. Your application should provide UI-agnostic logic for: 
● Creating and editing customer accounts 
● Creating and editing credit card accounts for existing customers 
● Reporting for monthly credit card transactions with filtering features 
 
2. Design and implement a component to generate random transactions for existing credit card accounts. This component can be either an integral module of main application, or a separate component (e.g. service or some sort of worker). 
 

## Getting Started
